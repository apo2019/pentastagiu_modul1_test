1. What is regression? What is retesting?
Regression Testing is usually performed before the release in Production of the sofware. It is used for retesting the major functionalities after deployment of new changes or fixes, in order to ensure that they still work as expected.
Retesting Testing is usually performed after a defect is fixed, in order to ensure that the issue was corrected and not reproducible anymore.


2. What is the relationship between the following: error, bug, defect, fault, failure.
The relationship between the above mentioned is that they all show issues found in the software application or product.


3. Name the difference between agile & v-model. (Please specify some roles and cycles for these)
In Agile Model the planning and estimation for the tasks is done with the entire team, whereas in V-Model all phases are separate and each of them is done by separate people.


4. Please state what is black box testing? How about white box testing? You can also give an example.
Black Box Testing is the type of methodology that offers access to the tester only to the Business Specifications documents and application, whereas White Box Testing is the type of methodology where the tester can also have access to the code itself.
